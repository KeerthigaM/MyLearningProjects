REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.	
REST is an architectural style not a protocol.
HTTP is a protocol which contains the set of REST architectural constraints.

REST fundamentals:
Everything in REST is considered as a resource.
Every resource is identified by an URI.
Uses uniform interfaces. Resources are handled using POST, GET, PUT, DELETE operations which are similar to CRUD operations.
Be stateless. Every request is an independent request. Each request from client to server must contain all the information necessary to understand the request.
Communications are done via representations. E.g. XML, JSON
