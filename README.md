Create a custom System variable so that all the required softwares can be set in the specific folder and we can repoint the global path to the custom path.

Kitty:
Overrides system actual path value to the custom path
eject:
Overrides system custom path value to the actual path

To do:
1.Copy and replace acutal path to the path variable in eject.bat
2.Add customEnv folder to actual path before running. so that it will be set as global and can be accessed from anywhere.
3.Add the necessary software in the custom path poiting to new folder and add other important paths from actual folder.
